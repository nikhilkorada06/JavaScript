            we open the website it will be blank till the file is downloaded. So we generally put this at last inside body tag.-->

           once the download is completed it will execute this java script file after the completion of HTML file.-->
        <!--Even if there are multiple defer files then it will download all the files in parallel with painting HTML after completion of painting 
            It will execute the downloaded files.-->

         <!--This also similar to defer. Here also script file download is initialized in parallel with painting of HTML. But here once the script 
             is downloaded browser won't wait for completion of HTML. It will start executing script file.-->
