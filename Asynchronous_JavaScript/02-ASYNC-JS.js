/**
 *               ASYNC JavaScript
 * 
 * JavaScript is a single threaded and synchronous language
 *      - single threaded basically means it will do one thing at a time..
          just like if there are two functions it can't execute both at a time 
          it can execute one by one.Even in a single function it can execute only 
          one line at a time.
        
        - synchronous language means it will always goes in an order it wont go 
          from line 1 to line 10 directly
